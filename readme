We picked three major counties in Austin to look at (2007-2017), U.S. Census data
to Analyze different contributing factors that causing housing price to flare up (population, wage, occupancy)
We came up with a list of questions that we wanted to answer using data viz.
How does the population growth compare to the rising housing costs?

the question answered here is 
What is Austinâ€™s housing availability over the past ten years?

How have rising costs affected personal finances? 
With housing costs increasing, have average wages increased as well? 
What ultimately is driving housing costs up?
