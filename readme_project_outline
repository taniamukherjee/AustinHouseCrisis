Moitivation
we all  went or going through home buying experience and we have found the frustration about housing price is very common 

We picked three major counties in Austin to look at (2007-2017), U.S. Census data
1. Hays County
2. Travis County
3. Williamson County

Analyze different contributing factors (population, wage, occupancy)

We came up with a list of questions that we wanted to answer using data viz
data analyses 
How does the population growth compare to the rising housing costs?

What is Austinâ€™s housing availability over the past ten years?

How have rising costs affected personal finances? With housing costs increasing, have average wages increased as well? 

What ultimately is driving housing costs up? 
Austin is one of the fastest growing cities and as a result, cost of living has increased
Since 2007, population has grown by 30% and average housing cost has increased by 41%*
Influx of population in the past decade
Vacancies stagnant shows people not moving out of Austin
People using less money for rent is increasing over the years
Despite the rising housing costs, people living more frugal lives, making smarter housing choices with technologies like Craigslist/Zillow, and making higher wages

Total occupied houses are growing rapidly over time while vacant houses remain flat, showing that demand has become much higher than supply

Ultimately it is supply vs. demand which is driving housing costs up. There are more people moving to Austin (110 per day*) than there are houses being built
